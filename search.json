    "text": "Narrative Feature Grouping: We have ~43 base narrative features (generally measured across 3 acts, totoally . Beyond analyzing them individually, how do you suggest grouping these features (e.g., by conceptual category like Emotion, Cognition, Style)?\nGenre Grouping: The dataset includes 57 detailed genre labels. For analyzing differences, what level of genre grouping do you recommend? (A simple Drama/Comedy/Other split?)\nSeason-Level Feature Processing: I’ve started aggregating features to the season level by calculating the mean per feature per act (e.g., anger_1_season_mean). However, our episode-level EDA showed high skewness and important peaks for many features, which the mean alone doesn’t capture. Is relying solely on the season mean sufficient?"

transportation measurement aims to assess how quickly a consumer becomes immersed in a story—both mentally and emotionally. It evaluates the extent to which they lose awareness of their surroundings and become absorbed in the narrative.\n\n\nsd_sum_1, sd_sum_2, sd_sum_3\nThe sum of the standard deviation per act, which aids us in understanding the amount of emotion variance for each act.\n\n\nsd_scaled_1, sd_scaled_2, sd_scaled_3\nThe standard deviation scaled across all emotions for ease of

Season Level Analysis\nNow, we aggregate narrative features to the season level. For each show and season, we calculate the mean of each narrative feature across all its episodes (e.g., anger_1_season_mean, sd_div_mean_2_season_mean). We then examine the summary statistics and distributions of these season-level averages.\nNote: We start to explore season-level patterns with the Mean, but based on our episode-level analysis, the mean ignores the intra-season variability information. Also, as we saw at the episode level, many features are highly skewed. Related to skewness, the mean doesn’t capture the intensity or frequency of peak emotional or narrative moments.\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics for Season-Level Mean Narrative Features\n\n\nSeason

Group 1: Immersion & Emotion\n\nNote: For Tone, below 50 is considered negative.\n\n\n4.1.2.2 Group 2: Stylistic & Structural\n\n\n\n4.1.2.3 Group 3: Cognitive Processes\n\n\n\n4.1.2.4 Group 4: Sensory & Perceptual Language\n\n\n\n4.1.2.5 Group 5: Motivational & Social Drives\n\n\n\n4.1.2.6 Group 6: Spatial & Temporal Orientation\n\nInterpretation\nThis season-level view, based only on feature means, highlights stylistic choices (analytic, tone, wc, etc.) as showing the most variation between seasons. While core emotional and cognitive averages are more consistent across seasons, outlier seasons exist, and the typical 3-act structure remains visible on average. For a complete picture, these mean-based findings should be complemented by analyzing intra-season variability (like SD per season) and peak intensity (like quantiles per season).\n\n\n\n\nSummary Table: Key Findings from Season-Level Narrative Statistics\n\n\nFinding Category\nObservation\nExample Variables & Values\nFor Downstream Analysis\n\n\n\n\n1. Distribution Smoothing\nAveraging across episodes reduces extreme values and generally reduces skewness compared to episode level.\ncertain_1_season_mean (Skew -0.06 vs. Episode 1.84); analytic_3_season_mean (Skew 0.41 vs. Episode 0.60).\nSeason-level means provide a more stable baseline, useful for modeling overall season outcomes (e.g., awards, ratings).\n\n\n2. Persistent Skewness\nDespite smoothing, some season averages remain highly skewed, indicating outlier seasons.\nPositive: joy_2 (Skew 3.44), wps_2 (Skew 7.26), power_1 (Skew 4.21).&lt;br&gt;Negative: dic_2 (Skew -11.41).\nInvestigate outlier seasons. Their unusual profiles may correlate with Profit (e.g., joy) or Prestige (power). Consider addressing skew in models.\n\n\n3. High Between-Season Variability\nStylistic, tonal, and structural features vary the most across seasons.\nanalytic (SD ~7-9), clout (SD ~7-8), tone (SD ~10-11), wc (SD ~23-26).\nPrioritize these high-variance features in season-level prediction models for Profit vs. Prestige outcomes.\n\n\n4. Low Between-Season Variability\nCore emotions and cognitive features are more stable across seasons.\nsadness (SD ~0.03), fear (SD ~0.03), insight (SD ~0.4), certain (SD ~0.2-0.3).\nThese features may require alternative metrics (e.g., medians, quantiles) to detect subtle but meaningful variation.\n\n\n5. Average Act Structure\nTypical 3-act arc patterns persist at the season level.\ncogproc_2_season_mean &gt; Acts 1/3; wc_3_season_mean &lt; Acts 1/2; neg_2_season_mean &gt; Acts 1/3.\nNarrative arc shape remains meaningful. Consider modeling act-to-act differences (e.g., Act2 - Act1).\n\n\n6. Limitation Reminder\nThis summary uses only season means and ignores intra-season peaks/variability.\nN/A\nComplement with intra-season SDs, medians, or quantiles for richer insight, especially for low-variance or skewed features."
